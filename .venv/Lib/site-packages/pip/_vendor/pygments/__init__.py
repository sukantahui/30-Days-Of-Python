    Pygments
    ~~~~~~~~

    Pygments is a syntax highlighting package written in Python.

    It is a generic syntax highlighter for general use in all kinds of software
    such as forum systems, wikis or other applications that need to prettify
    source code. Highlights are:

    * a wide range of common languages and markup formats is supported
    * special attention is paid to details, increasing quality by a fair amount
    * support for new languages and formats are added easily
    * a number of output formats, presently HTML, LaTeX, RTF, SVG, all image
      formats that PIL supports, and ANSI sequences
    * it is usable as a command-line tool and as a library
    * ... and it highlights even Brainfuck!

    The `Pygments master branch`_ is installable with ``easy_install Pygments==dev``.
